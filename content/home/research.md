  <b>Who cares about Inflation? - <br> Endogenous Expectation Formation of Heterogeneous Households</b>
</summary>
  
  <p align=justify>
  <font size="-1">
  This paper studies the effect of wealth levels on households' inflation expectations. Using data from the DNB Household Survey, we show absolute forecast errors as well as the dispersion of expectations across households to be decreasing in assets and debt. These patterns can be rationalized in a consumption-savings model with endogenous expectation formation, where households can exert effort to reduce uncertainty about future price changes. The implied consumption response to news about inflation is hump shaped in wealth: Wealthier households pay closer attention and update their expectations more in response to a signal received, but change their consumption less after any given update in expectations due to the income effect of future inflation. In a quantitative exercise, we show this mechanism to reduce the on-impact aggregate consumption response to forward guidance policies up to 55% compared to an attentive counterfactual.

  <b>Joint Search over the Life Cycle</b>
</summary>
  
  <p align=justify>
  <font size="-1">
  This paper studies how the added worker effect -- intra-household insurance through increased spousal labor market participation -- varies over the life-cycle. We show in U.S. data that the added worker effect is much stronger for young than for old households. A stochastic life-cycle model of two-member households with job search in a frictional labor market is capable of replicating this finding. The model suggests that a lower added worker effect for the old is driven primarily by better insurance through asset holdings. A shorter horizon until retirement during which labor force entry of the spouse pays off accounts for most of the remaining gap, with a smaller role for human capital differences between young and old. We discuss implications for labor market flows and the design of public insurance.

  <b>Distributional Effects of Bank Equity Losses</b>
</summary>
  
  <p align=justify>
  <font size="-1">
  This paper quantifies the distributional and welfare effects of severe shocks to the banking sector. We develop a heterogeneous-agent model featuring income and portfolio heterogeneity and a banking sector subject to financial frictions. We then study the dynamics of consumption and the welfare consequences along several dimensions of the income and wealth distribution in response to a severe bank equity shock. The negative overall impact on the economy masks substantial heterogeneity. Poor, liquidity-constrained agents are hit the hardest, owing to an increase in lending rates and a reduction in wages. Rich individuals can better insure against the shock and also take advantage of low asset prices and  high future returns on capital. As a consequence, around 4% of the population is better off after the shock hits. Computing households overall willingness to pay to avoid the bank disruption, we find that they would  be willing to give up a total amount of liquid wealth sufficient to cover the losses in the banking sector.
